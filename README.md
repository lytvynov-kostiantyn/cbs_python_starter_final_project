# Final project for Python Starter
## An entertaining chatbot on Python

### Description:
Bot can recommend movies, music and computer games by the genre. You can enjoy 'Guess the Number' and 
'Rock-Paper-Scissors' games. There also an additional section of entertainment in which you can find a selection 
of jokes and a module for converting a phrase into an 'ASCII art'.

***About***:

When the main menu of the application launched, the program waits for the correct input of the menu number from
the user. 

At selecting items with recommendations, the user opens a list of available genres. Next, the program waits
for the user to enter the name of the genre that he is interested in (the program is not case-sensitive)
from the genres list. After that, the user receives an accidental recommendation from the database.

If choosing the options of games, the user seems to be a list of available games. After choosing the game, the user
can(optional) enter his name, and the game process starts. The user can finish the game at any convenient moment for him. 

The section on additional entertainment does not require active participation from the user.
When choosing a joke option, the user is given one of the jokes from the database.
When choosing ASCII art, must be injected with a phrase that he wants to convert, after which the style and color
of the converting result will be randomly determined.
